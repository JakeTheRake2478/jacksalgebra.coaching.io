    <h1>Beta Participation Terms of Service (BPTOS)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> [5/6/25]</p>

    <p>By accepting access to the beta version of [jacksalgebra.github.io] ("the Website"), you ("Participant") acknowledge and agree to abide by the following terms and conditions. These Beta Participation Terms of Service (BPTOS) constitute a binding agreement between you and [GlitchX] ("we", "us", or "the Company"). Participation in this beta testing program is conditioned upon compliance with these provisions.</p>

    <h2>1. Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure</h2>
    <p>Participants agree to treat all aspects of the beta version of the Website—including, but not limited to, its design, features, code, content, and functionality—as strictly confidential. Disclosure of any information, whether through screenshots, source code, written descriptions, or otherwise, to any third party is expressly prohibited without prior written consent from GlitchX.</p>

    <h2>2. Prohibition of Unauthorized Distribution</h2>
    <p>Participants are strictly prohibited from sharing, distributing, reselling, sublicensing, or otherwise transferring their beta access credentials, codes, or any associated authorization mechanisms to any other individual or entity. Any such activity constitutes a material breach of these terms and will result in immediate revocation of access and potential legal recourse.</p>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property Protections</h2>
    <p>All content, design elements, proprietary algorithms, and structural components of the Website remain the sole intellectual property of the Company. Any attempt to replicate, reverse engineer, decompile, copy, clone, or otherwise reproduce the Website or any of its components—whether in whole or in part—is strictly forbidden and may result in legal action.</p>

    <h2>4. Usage Limitation</h2>
    <p>Beta access is granted for the sole purpose of evaluation and feedback. Participants shall not use the Website for commercial purposes, competitive analysis, or benchmarking. Use of the Website in any production environment or manner inconsistent with its intended beta testing purpose is prohibited.</p>

    <h2>5. Termination and Revocation of Access</h2>
    <p>The Company reserves the right to terminate or suspend beta access at its sole discretion, without prior notice, particularly in cases of suspected breach of this Agreement. Upon termination, the Participant shall cease all access and use of the Website and destroy any materials or information obtained through the beta program.</p>

    <h2>6. Feedback</h2>
    <p>Participants may be invited to submit feedback. By submitting feedback, you grant the Company an unrestricted, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, modify, and incorporate such feedback into the Website or other products, without any obligation to compensate you.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>The Website is provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis during the beta period. The Company disclaims all warranties, express or implied. In no event shall the Company be liable for any damages arising from participation in the beta program.</p>

    <h2>8. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [Orange County J.C : 30], without regard to its conflict of law principles.</p>

    <h2>9. Required Donation and Refund Policy</h2>
    <p>As a condition of beta participation, users are required to provide a nominal donation—typically ranging from $1 to $2 USD—which directly supports the development and maintenance of the Website during its beta phase. This donation functions as a prerequisite for obtaining a beta access code and does not constitute a purchase of a finalized product. All donations are final and strictly non-refundable, irrespective of access issues, dissatisfaction, or early termination of participation. By submitting a donation, you expressly acknowledge and agree to this no-refund policy.</p>

    <h2>10. User Responsibility and Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>Participants are solely responsible for ensuring that their access to and use of the Website complies with all applicable institutional, educational, workplace, or legal policies and regulations. The Company assumes no responsibility and shall not be held liable for any disciplinary action, penalties, or consequences incurred by Participants as a result of accessing the Website in prohibited or unauthorized environments, including but not limited to schools, workplaces, or restricted networks. Use the Website at your own discretion and risk.</p>

    <h2>11. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>Participants agree not to engage in any of the following activities while using the Website: Attempting to bypass security features or access controls; Uploading or transmitting malware, harmful code, or disruptive content; Harassing, abusing, or threatening other users; Misrepresenting identity or affiliation; Using automated tools or bots to interact with the Website;  Sharing exploitative, offensive, or illegal content through the Website.</p>

    <h2>12. Account Suspension and Access Limits</h2>
    <p>The Company reserves the right to limit, suspend, or permanently revoke beta access at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, abuse, violation of these Terms, or any behavior deemed detrimental to the testing environment.</p>

    <h2>13. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>The Website may collect anonymous usage data, including browser type, session duration, and interaction patterns, for the sole purpose of improving functionality and performance. No personally identifiable information will be shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>14. Duration of Beta Program</h2>
    <p>The beta phase is temporary and subject to change or termination at the Company’s discretion. Access granted during the beta period does not guarantee access to the final release or future versions of the Website.</p>

    <h2>15. Modification of Terms</h2>
    <p>The Company reserves the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Continued participation in the beta program after such modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
